# Li_M_MINI-APP

### Decription
Use everything we’ve covered so far - SASS, Vue, AJAX, databases
and Fetch to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. Click on one of the Mini
models to show more content / data about that model. You will be navigating around in your app
using Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.


### Decription
Create an AJAX request for the mini data housed in your database using the Fetch API or the
XHTTP object. Use that application state to build out your application’s view (the mini app
splash/home page).

### build instructions
1. Place project folder into var/www/html (or respective folder).
2. Open server folder inside the project folder. Open db.js. Check the mysql credentials and use them for the database setup.
3. Start server by going into the server folder from the terminal. Type command "node index".
4. In a separate terminal, navigate to the project folder.
5. Execute command "npm run dev".
6. Copty the url that the application is running on.
7. Paste the url into a browser, and you will have access to the project website.
