# Li_M_MINI-APP

#Use everything weâ€™ve covered so far - SASS, Vue, AJAX, databases
and Fetch to create a dynamic one-page app based on our class build. Click on one of the Mini
models to show more content / data about that model. You will be navigating around in your app
using Vue lifecycle hooks, components, and AJAX where appropriate.
